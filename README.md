# Whale_Tail_Identifier

## Project Description

This project is my solution to the Kaggle Humpback Whale Identification Challenge. To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists rely on captured images to identify whale species by the shape of their tails and unique markings. The challenge is to build an algorithm that can help identify individual whales on images. 

## Dataset

The original training dataset was submitted to Kaggle by HappyWhale. The data contained approximately 25K images of whales (comprising 5,005 different whale species, including a "new_whale" category for yet unidentified whale types). 

Examples of different images pertaining to one whale type:
